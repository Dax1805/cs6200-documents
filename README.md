# CS6200 / IS4200: Document and Link Analysis

After cloning this repository, you can edit the two Jupyter notebooks locally or an a hosted platform like Google Colab. Read through the notebooks, filling in code and explanations in the blocks starting with "TODO". Note that the last section is only required for CS6200 students.

Whenever you'd like to save your work, and when you are done, make sure to check in and push to GitHub (if working locally) or, in Colab, click on "Save in GitHub" at the top of the screen. There is one possible pitfall: Unlike the first homework, for which you created public repositories of annotated data, this assignment creates private repositories so that others cannot see your code. Before saving from Google Colab for the firsst time, you should go to the Colab homepage at https://colab.research.google.com/ and select the GitHub tab. en make sure the "Include private repos" checkbox is checked.

The first notebook, `term_statistics.ipynb`, walks through some simple exercises computing term statistics from Associted Press newswire and plotting their distribution. For students in CS6200, there are additional exercises on acquiring documents from the _Chronicling America_ API.

The second notebook, `PageRank.ipynb`, has you implementing a PageRank computation on a graph of .edu websites from the Common Crawl.  (We are working with websites, rather then webpages, to make the graph smaller and less sparse.)
